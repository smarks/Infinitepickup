# Infinitepickup
a platform that allows connected players the ability to share a deck(s) of cards virtually.  Infinitepickup does "know" the rules of any specific card games, but it does know how to manage the logistics around deck management. Players can draw cards, discard cards, decks can shuffled etc.
